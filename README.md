## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karimosman89/Drug-Discovery-and-Protein-Engineering-with-Generative-AI.git
    cd Drug-Discovery-and-Protein-Engineering-with-Generative-AI
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Installation and Setup

## Usage Examples

(Note: A `requirements.txt` file will be added in the next phase. For now, assume dependencies are installed.)

### Example: De Novo Molecule Generation

```python
# drug_discovery_and_protein_engineering_with_generative_ai.py

import random

def generate_random_molecule_formula(length=5):
    elements = ["C", "H", "O", "N", "S", "P"]
    formula = ""
    for _ in range(length):
        formula += random.choice(elements) + str(random.randint(1, 5))
    return formula

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Generating a random molecule formula:")
    for _ in range(3):
        print(generate_random_molecule_formula())
```

## Results and Demonstrations

This project provides foundational examples for applying Generative AI in drug discovery and protein engineering. The `drug_discovery_and_protein_engineering_with_generative_ai.py` script demonstrates a simple de novo molecule generation. Future work will focus on more complex models for structure prediction and binding affinity.

## Future Work

*   Implement advanced generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) for molecular design.
*   Integrate deep learning models for accurate protein structure prediction.
*   Develop robust binding affinity prediction algorithms.
*   Create a user-friendly interface for molecular design and visualization.
